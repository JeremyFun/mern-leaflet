![Application](./Application.png)

# Description
This application uses the mongodb database that automatically connects to your database, but for this you must have the database client loaded on your pc, below there will be a link to install the database.
Choose the operating system you need on your pc, maybe it's Windows or Linux.
If you are using Linux as I am, then install the Robo3t application, through it you can conveniently use the database
